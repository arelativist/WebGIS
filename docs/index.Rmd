<!-- This creates tabbed content for all the following sections that are one-level below. -->

## `c()`


The function `c()` *combines* or *concatenates* its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

- All of the elements must be of the same *type*.
  - I can't combine character and numeric types in the same call to `c()`

Here's two examples using numeric and character data types:

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13)

# Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the `print()` function.

```{r}
# Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec

# The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)
```


## `data.frame()`

A data frame contains columns and rows, where each column contains the same number of items. I can create a data frame using the function `data.frame()`

- Rows must be of the same length
- Data stored can be factor, numeric, or character type
- Columns must be of the same data type

The data frame can be defined by defining each column, as shown below:
  


```{r}
## build a data frame from scratch

dat_1 <- data.frame(
  letters = c("f", "t", "w"),
  numbers_1 = c(42,6, 31415956))

## I can print the contents by typing the name of the data frame

dat_1

```

Some ways to subset a data frame:

- If I know the name of a column, I can use `$`


```{r}
## Here I will use subset a column by name

dat_1$letters

```

- You can also subset a data frame, using `subset()` !

```{r}
## Creating a subset using subset()

sub_1 <- subset(dat_1, letters == "f")

sub_1

```

To access a particular location within a data frame, I can use square brackets!

```{r}
## access a location within a dataframe

dat_1[3,2] ##Accesses location in the data frame at row 3, column 2

```

Don't forget that the Index starts at 1!!


## `matrix()`

A matrix is a two dimensional data structure that can be created using the function `matrix()`.

A matrix has a defined dimension and must be comprised of a single data type.

- a matrix may be created from a vector by applying a dimension


```{r matrix()}

## Create a matrix from scratch

new_matrix <- matrix(1:18, nrow = 6, ncol = 3) 

## the first argument is the data for the matrix
## nrow and ncol define the dimensions, only one is required

##display new matrix

new_matrix

```

Square brackets can also be used on a matrix to access a specific location:


```{r square brax}

## access the value at row four and column three of the new matrix

new_matrix[4,3]

```



## `length()`

The function `length()` either retrieves or sets the length of an object. 

```{r}
## Use length() to retrieve a length

vect <- c(1:18)
length(vect)

```

```{r}
## Use length() to set the length
## Establish and print vector

vect <- c(1:18)
vect

## set the length


length(vect) <- 9
vect

```

## `nrow()`

The function `nrow()` either sets or retrieves the number of rows in a matrix:
```{r}

##nrow() can set the rows:
matrix <- matrix(18:35, nrow = 6)
matrix

##and nrow() can retrieve the rows:

nrow(matrix)

```



## `ncol()`
The function `ncol()` either sets or retrieves the number of columns in a matrix:
```{r}
## ncol() can set the columns:

matrix <- matrix(18:35, ncol = 6)
matrix

## and ncol() can retrieve the columns:

ncol(matrix)

```



## `dim()`

To create a matrix from a vector, use the function `dim()`:


```{r}
## To create a matrix from a vector, first establish the vector:

vect <- c(1:18)

## Then apply dimension using dim()

dim(vect) <- c(3,6)

vect

```

Similar to `length()`, `dim()` can also be used to retrieve the dimensions of something:

```{r}
matrix <- matrix(18:35, ncol = 6)

dim(matrix)

```


# Functions 2: Numerical Data Exploration  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `summary()`

To get a brief synopsis of an object, I can use the function `summary()`:

```{r}
## load the palmerpenguins package
require(palmerpenguins)

## demonstrate
summary(penguins)
```

This can be very useful in an initial exploration of your data


## `mean()`

The `mean()` function can be used to retrieve the mean of a set of data:

```{r}
## load the palmerpenguins package
require(palmerpenguins)


##demonstrate
## the argument na.rm removes NA values in this calculation

mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)


```



## `sd()`

The `sd()` function calculates standard deviation:

```{r}
## load the palmerpenguins package
require(palmerpenguins)

## demonstrate
## the argument na.rm removes NA values in this calculation

sd(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

 


# Functions 3: Graphical Data Exploration {.tabset .tabset-pills}

See the final project description for a list of the required functions.

## `plot()`


I can use `plot()` to create scatterplots! 


```{r scatterplot_1, fig.asp = 0.7}

## load the penguins package:
require(palmerpenguins)

## using formula notation:
## I can use the pch argument to change the symbol

plot(
  bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g,
  data = penguins,
  pch = 6)


```

## `boxplot()`

The function `boxplot()` can be used to create boxplots!

- This can be used to plot both conditional and simple boxplots:

```{r}

## Load the palmerpenguins package:
require(palmerpenguins)

## a single boxplot:
boxplot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, 
        main = "Flipper Length (mm)",
        ylab = "length")  ## here the main and ylab arguments are providing labels

## A conditional boxplot :
boxplot(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins, 
        ## the first argument tells it which data to plot and which 
        ## to condition it by, using the ~ (tilda)
        main = "Flipper Length by Species",
        ## again, labels
        ylab = "Flipper Length (mm)")

```



## `hist()`

I can create a histogram using the function `hist()`!

```{r}
## import the penguin data:
require(palmerpenguins)

## create a histogram
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Length",
     xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)")

```

`hist` has many arguments, but one important one is `breaks =`:

- set the argument `breaks` to alter the number of bins in your histogram:


```{r}

## make a histogram with 40 bins:

hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     breaks = 40, ## here I specify the breaks
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Length",
     xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)")

```

## `par() and mfrow=`

The function `par()` with the argument `mfrow=` can be used to plot more than one graph at a time!

- This can be useful to combine more than one graph
- `mfrow=` uses a vector:

```{r fig.asp = 1}
## this is how to implement the par() function:

par(mfrow = c(1,2)) ##mfrow describes the layout. Here, 1X2
## The graphs following par() will be plotted together
boxplot(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins, 
        main = "Flipper Length by Species",
        ylab = "Flipper Length (mm)")
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     breaks = 40,
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Length",
     xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)")

```




# Functions 4: Distribution Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `dnorm()`

The function `dnorm()` can be used to calculate the probability density of a normal distribution!

- For example:
```{r}

## The following will return the height of the curve of the normal distribution
## at X = 12
## for a normal distribution where the mean is 18 and the standard deviation is 6:

dnorm(12, mean = 18, sd = 6)

```


## `pnorm()`

The function `pnorm()` returns the cumulative density for a normal distribution! 

- `pnorm()` gives me the value of the probability of observing `x` or *less*

```{r}
## What is the probability of observing a value less than 15 in a normal distribution with a mean of 18 and a standard deviation of 6

pnorm(15, mean = 18, sd = 6)

```

In this case we return 30.85% probability!



## `qnorm()`

The function `qnorm()` returns the value at a quantile of a normal distribution!

- `qnorm()` gives me the value at the specified percentile, `p`
- percentile argument must be given as a decimal 


```{r}
## What is the value at the 31% percentile for a standard distribution with a mean of 18 and a standard deviation of 6?

qnorm(0.31, mean = 18, sd = 6)

```

Here, we return something close to 15.

## `dbinom()`

Similar to `dnorm()`, the function `dbinom()` returns probability, but returns it for a binomial distribution. In a binomial distribution, we call it probability mass instead of density.

- `dbinom()` will give us the probability of observing a value (x) in a binomial distribution:



```{r dbinom}

## what is the probability of observing 5 successes (x), in a binomial distribution with twenty trials (size) and a success rate of 25% (prob)

dbinom(5, size = 20, prob = .25)

```

Here we get an answer close to 20%

## `qbinom()`

`qbinom()` is a function that give us the quantile of a binomial distribution

- We can use `qbinom()` to return the value at a quantile of a binomial distribution:

```{r qbinom}

## what is the 20th quantile of a binomial distribution with a size of 20 and a probability of 25%?

qbinom(.20, size = 20, prob = .25)

```
And the answer is 3.




# Functions 5: Other Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `subset()`

The function `subset()` can be used to isolate data from a data frame.


```{r}
## import penguins data
require(palmerpenguins)

## summarize the data to look for something to subset:
summary(penguins)

## create a subset!
dat_adelie <- subset(penguins, species == "Adelie")

## test the subset
head(dat_adelie)

```

Here we have subsetted the penguin data into just one species, Adelie.

## `library() and require()`

The `library()` and `require()` functions can be used to import pre-installed code and datasets that come with R. These are called packages. 

- The first time you access a package, you should use `install.packages()` to bring it in to R
- They can be used interchangeably but `require()` is necessary for use inside of a function


```{r}
## Using library() to load a package of code that we need:
library(stats)

## This is the package that we have been using for our distribution functions. Here we can see a description:
packageDescription("stats")

## another package that we have been relying heavily upon is the palmer penguins data package
library(palmerpenguins)

## this package has supplied us with our penguin data
packageDescription("palmerpenguins")

```


## `read.csv()`

The function `read.csv()` is used to import data from a local csv file:

```{r read.csv}

### Import data using read.csv function

dat_delomys <- read.csv("data/delomys.csv")

## Test the import
summary(dat_delomys)

```


Using `summary()`, we can see that the data did indeed import.



# Part 2: Data Anaylsis

Now that it is imported, we will preform a data analysis on the Delomys data.

## Numerical Exploration
We will start with a numerical exploration:

### Summary of `dat_delomys`:
```{r delomys summary, echo=FALSE}

## Show a summary of the delomys data:
summary(dat_delomys)
```
### Shapiro Tests
``` {r shapiro, echo = FALSE}
## test the normality of body mass:
shapiro.test(dat_delomys$body_mass)

## test the normality of body length:
shapiro.test(dat_delomys$body_length)

```

Since both of these return a p-value that is much lower than .05, we know that our variables are not normally distributed.


## Graphical Exploration {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Scatterplot

```{r scatterDat, fig.asp = 1, echo = FALSE}
## scatter plot of body length by body mass
plot(dat_delomys$body_length, dat_delomys$body_mass, 
     main = "Delomys Body Length and Body Mass", 
     xlab = "Body Length", ylab = "Body Mass")
```

### Histograms
```{r massHist, echo = FALSE}
## body mass histogram

hist(dat_delomys$body_mass, breaks = 20,
     main = "Histogram of Delomys Body Mass",
     xlab = "Body Mass")

## body length histogram

hist(dat_delomys$body_length, breaks = 20,
     main = "Histogram of Delomy Body Length",
     xlab = "Body Length")

```


### Boxplots
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.asp=1}

## body mass conditioned on species

boxplot(body_mass ~ binomial, 
        data = dat_delomys, 
        main = "Delomys Body Mass by Species", 
        xlab = "Species", ylab = "Body Mass")

## body mass conditioned on sex

boxplot(body_mass ~ sex, 
        data = dat_delomys, 
        main = "Delomys Body Mass by Sex", 
        xlab = "Sex", ylab = "Body Mass")

## body mass conditioned on both

boxplot(body_mass ~ sex*binomial, 
        data = dat_delomys, 
        names=c("Female \n D. dorsalis", 
                "Male \n D.dorsalis", "Female \n D. sub", "Male \n D. sub"),
        xlab = NULL, 
        ylab = "Body Mass", 
        main = "Delomys Body Mass by Species and Sex", 
        las =2)

```

### Interpretation

1. It appears that body mass and length have a linear relationship. It appears visually that the have a positive linear relationship, with several outliers that have much longer body length.

2. The histograms appear to have a somewhat normal distribution. Body mass histogram appears more normal, and body length, again appears to have several outliers positively.

3. Given the low p-values of the shapiro test for both variables, it seems that they are not normally distributed. Visually, body mass appears to be normally distributed. Length only appears somewhat normally distributed visually. Unconditioned, I would say neither is normally distributed.

4. Based on the conditional boxplots, it appears that D.Dorsalis has a greater body mass, and that the males of both species have a greater body mass as well. The difference in mean body mass between the sexes is greateer in D. Dorsalis, but is present in both species.


## Model Building 

Now we construct the models:

```{r}

fit1 <- lm(body_length ~ body_mass, data = dat_delomys) ## simple linear regression
fit2 <- lm(body_mass ~ sex, data = dat_delomys)   ## 1-way ANOVA
fit3 <- lm(body_mass ~ binomial, data = dat_delomys)  ## 1-way ANOVA
fit4 <- lm(body_mass ~ sex + binomial, data = dat_delomys) ## 2-way additive ANOVA  
fit5 <- lm(body_mass ~ sex*binomial, data = dat_delomys) ## 2-way factorial ANOVA

```


## Model Diagnostics {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Visual Diagnostic

Here we use histograms of the residuals as a visual diagnostic:

```{r echo = FALSE}

hist(residuals(fit1), breaks = 20, 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals of Fit 1")
hist(residuals(fit2), breaks = 20, 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals of Fit 2")
hist(residuals(fit3), breaks = 20, 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals of Fit 3")
hist(residuals(fit4), breaks = 20, 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals of Fit 4")
hist(residuals(fit5), breaks = 20, 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals of Fit 5")

```

### Numerical Diagnostic

Here we use the Shapiro-Wilk test on the residuals of our models as a numerical diagnostic:

```{r echo = FALSE}

shapiro.test(residuals(fit1))
shapiro.test(residuals(fit2))
shapiro.test(residuals(fit3))
shapiro.test(residuals(fit4))
shapiro.test(residuals(fit5))

```

### Interpretation

1. Although visually many of the models appear to have a normal distribution, they all return values that demonstrate a violation of the normality assumption under a Shapiro-Wilk normality test.

2. Not all of the models violate the normality assumption with equal severity. While Fit 1, the linear model, appears violate with the most severity, Fit 2, the one way ANOVA based on Sex, appears to have the residuals closest to normality of the models that we have fit.


## Model Interpretation {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Body Length

#### Model Coefficient Table: Body Length ~ Body Mass
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## print model coefficient table

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit1)))

```

#### Interpretation

- The magnitude of the mass / length relationship is 0.875
- The expected body length of an animal that weighs 100g would be 163
- The expected body length of an animal that weight 0 G would be 76




### Body Mass: Model Coefficients

#### Model Coefficient Table: Body Mass ~ Sex

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## print model coefficient table 
## fit 2 ( mass x sex)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit2)))
```

#### Model Coefficient Table: Body Mass ~ Species
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## print model coefficient table
## fit 3 ( mass x species)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit3)))

```

#### Interpretation

- The base level for sex is female.
- The base level for binomial is D. Dorsalis
- Male is heavier, as you can see by the positive coefficient from the base
- D. Dorsalis is heavier, as you can see by the negative coefficient from the base



### Body Mass: ANOVA

#### ANOVA Table: body_mass ~ sex + binomial

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## print ANOVA table
## fit 4 body_mass ~ sex + binomial

knitr::kable(anova(fit4))

```

#### ANOVA Table: body_mass ~ sex * binomial
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## print ANOVA table
## fit 5 body_mass ~ sex * binomial

knitr::kable(anova(fit5))

```

#### Interpretation

- Sex or species alone are not a significant predictor of body mass.
- However, there is a significant interaction between the two.
- The significance differs between the single-predictor, additive, and interactive models. While there appears to be no significance to single-predictor or additive models, the interactive model is significant when both variables are used. While sex or species alone are not significant predictors, taken together as an interaction they are.



## Model Comparison : Body Mass

Finally, we will compare our models using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

#### AIC: Model 1
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## AIC: Model 1
AIC(fit1)
```
#### AIC: Model 2
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## AIC: Model 2
AIC(fit2)
```
#### AIC: Model 3
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## AIC: Model 3
AIC(fit3)
```
#### AIC: Model 4
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## AIC: Model 4
AIC(fit4)
```
#### AIC: Model 5
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## AIC: Model 5
AIC(fit5)
```

#### Interpretation

- Models 2 and 4 have the lowest AIC.
- Though model 2 has a much lower AIC than model 4, in this case I would select model 4, because in this case I think that the added complexity and reduced ease of understanding would be worth the extra insight gained. Also from our previous inquiry, I know that this model creates more significance, and provides more more insight for only a small gain in complexity.
